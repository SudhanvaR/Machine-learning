Calories Burnt Prediction
Welcome to the Calories Burnt Prediction repository! This repository contains the machine learning project aimed at predicting the amount of calories burnt by a person based on their age, weight, and exercise.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to accurately predict the number of calories a person burns during a workout based on certain biological measures. This information can be useful for fitness enthusiasts, trainers, and healthcare professionals to tailor workout plans and monitor progress.

Algorithms Used
We have employed multiple regression algorithms to predict the amount of calories burnt, including:

Linear Regression
XGBRegressor
Lasso
RandomForestRegressor
Ridge
After thorough evaluation, we found that XGBRegressor provided the optimal output with minimal absolute error.

Key Features
Predictive Analysis: Estimates calories burnt based on age, weight, and exercise type.
Multiple Algorithms: Comparison of various regression algorithms to determine the most accurate model.
Error Minimization: Selection of the model with the lowest prediction error.
Results
Our experiments concluded that the XGBRegressor model delivers the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy and minimal absolute error, making it the preferred choice for this application.
